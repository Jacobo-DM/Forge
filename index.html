  <h2>The Bellows of the Forge</h2>
  <p>
    The Forge is not a static archive. It is a living fire fed by breath, movement,
    and practice. <strong>The Bellows of the Forge</strong> are the rhythms that keep
    that fire alive — the pulses that turn warmth into heat, and heat into
    transformation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practice, the Bellows show up as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Breath cycles</strong> from RageDance and other movement practices</li>
    <li><strong>Attention pulses</strong> from DiscoveryMode fieldwork and reflection</li>
    <li><strong>Story resonance</strong> from Flower Road projects and shared narratives</li>
    <li><strong>Communal ignition</strong> when students, neighbors, or readers light up</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When a thread stalls, when a project feels cold, or when confusion creeps in,
    we “bring the Bellows online” — returning to breath, presence, and small,
    repeatable actions that restore heat and direction without force.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bellows do not command the fire. They invite it, awaken it, and sustain it.
